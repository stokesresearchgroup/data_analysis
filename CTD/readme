This folder contains some matlab scripts (.m) 
for the import of data and data preparation for further use (dataimport.m).
It was originally used to prepare the data for geostrophic calculation.
I tried to set this as automatic as possible, 
but scan the script before running it, depending on the original file,
from which you want to import your data, you might want to edit some settings, 
e.g. number of columns and column assignment to variables.
The folder contains some example data and a licence as well.
